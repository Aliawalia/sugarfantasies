                Hello!! This is where I horribly explain Ethel Cains art, and my experience with her. Im bad at naming
                things but her general vibe is like going to church with your parents late at night for bible study.
                <img src="ethel/1.webp" /> I kinda can't express it in any other words for people that never went to
                church. I have very vivid memories of entering that old church building, hearing the cries of the
                sisters. Its really specific. Alot of her work in deeply rooted in religous trauma and southern things,
                im not southern though so I kinda can't say anything accurate about that. <br />
                <i> Praying straight to God that maybe you'll come back around</i>
                <br />
                I think this is where I talk about my experiences?? Okay so i discovered her through Ptolemaea (the
                song) I know thats kinda odd since like thats the most disturbing song out of all of them.
                <img class="leftimg" src="/ethel/2.webp" />Then i was like wow! Amazing voice so I listened to the whole
                album. Then up until like this year i realized shit theres really deep lore, so I just went insane and
                started obsessing over the story and her music. The thing that I love the most is her story writing and
                how she really shows the pain of losing faith in god, while tryna keep your own life stable. Her music
                really is just my life (minus the southern part). <br />
                <i
                    >Sunday morning Hands over my knees in a room full of faces I'm sorry if I seemed off, but I was
                    probably wasted
                </i>
                <br />
                <small>this section is about my horrible relationship with god, has mentions of my trauma. </small
                ><br />
                I grew up not in a small town but a very conservative asian christian community. Like so much so that
                music wasn't allowed unless it was classical or hymns. I grew up knowing how to pray before knowing how
                to add. Thats how religous I was. I dont even remember how i decided I didnt want to be christian
                anymore, i jsut remember it was around when i was 11-13?? I got baptized when i was 8 im pretty sure.
                The reason why i lost faith was that my father was physically abusive, and in the bible it would say
                that you shouldn't lay hands on another person.... <img src="ethel/3.webp" />and my father was a
                preacher. So how could somebody that reads the bible every single day get a simple thing wrong?? Also, i
                just dont like the fact that God has to put us through 'lessons' to try and test us or whatever. There
                shouldn't be a time where a kid is groomed or anything like that done that to them. And if god really is
                almighty he should've prevented that. "but oh god works in mysterious ways, he gave us free will" To be
                honest I hear that all the time, it just sounds like an excuse at this point. Yes god gave us free will,
                doesn't mean he should let that happen to little kids though. Whatever. Yeah my dad hit me, yes my mom
                is bipolar, schizoed out, told me she was gonna kill herself for God, litterally tried to crash her car
                when i told her i might not be christian anymore. All of those things dont really help with my faith
                already fading LMFAO. also all throughout my childhood my mother would say stuff like "when I die, if
                you're not good you wont see me in heaven anymore" or stuff like "if you die tommorow you will be sent
                to hell" i was 6 when I was told this btw. Alot of the people in my church used fear as a way to get us
                to read the bible. Stuff like if you do this you'll be sent to hell. We were all 5-6 when they would say
                this. <img class="leftimg" src="ethel/4.webp" /> Also for some reason explained in detail what would
                happen to us in hell, and what happened to the people in hell. yeah i dont think you should be
                describing litteral gore to children. Thats really all. I lost faith because of the people around me,
                and im not saying christianity is bad, there are a few true christians, but not enough. Id be christian
                now if my church wasn't filled with schizos, but now im just repulsed by the idea of that. Especially
                when our punishment as a kid was being locked up in the basement of the church, not pleasent. I just
                have a really bad relationship with the Bible and Churches in general. I still pray sometimes<br />
                <i> God loves you, but not enough to save you So, baby girl, good luck taking care of yourself</i>

            <div class="page" id="about">
                About Hayden Silas Anhedönia, also know as Ethel Cain, she was born on March 24, 1998 in Tallahasee but
                raised in Perry, Florida. Oldest of 4 in a Southern baptist family. Her father was a deacon, and she was
                in the church choir like her mom. At 8, she started playing the piano, church basically influences
                everything when you grow up in these kinda communities. She was homeschooled and left church at 16. She
                came out as gay at 12, and at 20 came out as trans. <br /><br />
                "Whether I like it or not, God always has and always will be a huge part of my life. Whether he's being
                used as a comforting figure or a threat, I've always been surrounded by it. It's not really something
                you can walk away from. And I'd rather just sit with it than be like 'Fuck the church!'"<br />
                <br />
                Thats kinda all, I really like her voice, its like soft and ugh idk its like a soft warm floral scent to
                me... like not warm like a mothers hug but warm like sitting far away from the fire. idk. I like to
                watch her videos on youtube, its nice listening to somebody talk

                however is stuck in the past, begging for her to stay. Because Ethel is so insecure it leads to
                provocation, telling Janie that she should just leave and toss her away. However, Ethel just needs
                somebody to stay with her forever. She cries for Janie, begs her to atleast come and visit her sometime.

                <h2>Willoughby's theme</h2>
                Theres no lyrics, just a beautiful instrumental that makes me cry from the first note. I think that in
                the beginning its just Ethel, the piano and all. Representing femininity, then the electric guitar comes
                in as Willoughby. The masculine side, a guy that Ethel always wanted. The support she needed from her
                father is found here instead. God this song makes me cry so hard
                <h2>Fuck Me Eyes</h2>
                PEAK OMG I LOVE THIS SONG ITS MY ALARM!! This song talks about the rumors surrounding Holly Reddick.
                Ethel hates her because the hangs around Willougby and she's convinced that Holly is gonna steal her
                huzz.<br />
                <br />

                <br />
                <br />
                Its not really important to the lore, very good song. Ethel just compares herself to Holly, saying that
                if Willougby is interested in Holly that she has no chance because she'll never be like her<br />
                <br />
                <i>
                    I'll never blame her, I kinda hate her<br />
                    I'll never be that kind of angel<br />
                    I'll never be kind enough to me<br />
                    I'll never blame her for trying to make it<br />

                <br />
                <h2>Nettles</h2>
                Crying already actually, it talks about how Willoughby and Ethel Are starting their relationship, and
                because Ethel is actually me she started to overthink about how she'll lose him, and dreaming life where
                its just them. In the first verse shes plauged by thoughts of losing him, crying and hoping all of this
                (her trauma and his) is wrth it at the end. In the chorus he comforts her, telling her to think of all
                the time that she'll have with him when she wont wake up on her own. This song is called Nettles because
                Ethel thinks that she's like a Nettle. <br />
                <br />

                She doesn't believe that its worth anything to love her, since it'll only end up badly. oh mny god im
                crying alreayd FUCK i cant do this uugh. <br />

                Just enjoy it
                <h2>Dust Bowl</h2>
                Hayden Sampled duster for this!! Amazing!! Ethel and Willoughby are making out in a drive in movie, A
                big issue for Ethel is that she projects this idea onto people, then doesn't listen to a word they say.
                Willoughby tries to explain who he is, but ethel doesnt realize that until he leaves. <br />
                <br />

                    When I rode home crying<br />
                    Thinking of you fucking other girls<br />
                    But when you<br />
                    Said that you're in love<br />
                    I never wondered if you're sure
                </i>
                <br />
                <br />
                Instead of facing their issues, they turn to drugs to cope. Ethel only knows love through pain. Love is
                only given to her through physical or emotional pain.
                <h2>A Knock at the Door</h2>
                I litterally cannot understand this song, or listen to it
                <h2>Radio towers</h2>
                A tornado hits Shady Grove, the beeping in the back can be interpreted as a heart monitor or the radio
                towers deeping
                <h2>Tempest</h2>
                This is the only song from Willoughby's perspective. Willoughbys greatest fear is storms, or anything
                like that. But Ethel never really understood that, she only saw him as the toughened man in her life. he
                begs her to see him the way he really his, that hes not a perfect person that she fantasizes about.
                Inorder to love somebody you have to be open to understand them, which is something that Ethel never
                did.

                <br />
                Over all this album isn't really about the lore, its like a background/introuction to Ethels life. In
                the beginning you see her insecurities, learning who she really is. Comparing herself to Holly and
                begging janie to come back. She dates willoughby then they break up. Next is Preachers Daughter!!
                <h1>Preachers Daughter</h1>
                Preachers daughter is about Ethels life, rather than her love life. This album actually came out before
                WTIALY so alot of witaly's lyrics mention songs from this album. This album is the first in a trilogy
                about Ethel Cain and her family tree, the whole idea is on intergenerational trauma, religious trauma
                and living in america (the next albums are supposed to be about Ethels mother and grandmother),,, the
                record is set in 1991 a decade after the death of Ethel’s father, the towns preacher. Ethel was last
                seen in Arlington, Texas on January 13th in a Winn-Dixie parking lot. She was knocked out by a blond man
                and put into a short bed black pick up truck.

                <h2>Family Tree (intro)</h2>
                baisically this song introduces Ethel's life, tallking about her past. since their town is so small her
                dad is the towns preacher, so it's about her life as the towns preachers daugher. At this point she's no
                longer Christian, and about how she can never escape god. Ethel cannot escape her past, she will always
                be knows as the preachers daughter, even after her death.

                <h2>American Teenager</h2>
                One of ethel cain's most popular songs, for good reason too!! Shady Grove is an insanely religious town.
                Since like forever, she's is taught to put her life into God, being told her life is for the Church and
                Jesus Christ. To live her life like this from her father. Now looking back at her past with the church
                and her father she realises she put too much trust into what she thought would be comfort was actually
                abuse and trauma. After her dad dies, she's forced to preach infront of the town to try and preserve his
                legacy. Inorder to numb the pain of losing Willoughby she drinks, then comes to service drunks, and
                tries to deliver a message.

                nebraska, however it's a house thats on the edge of town, which ethel and willoughby both run away to.
                Running away from their lives at home. Ethel wants him back (mee too girl) she regrets everything she
                duid. But at the end of day she knows that nothing will make him come back to her.

                <h2>Western Nights</h2>
                She gets a new boyfriend, named Logan Phelps. hes so abusive towards Ethel, but she's so hopelessly
                inlove with him. something that I can say is that i was always taught "i hit you because i love you"
                from a young age. So for a while I just thought pain is a normal way to feel love. Logan uses her for
                her body, she can only feel love when hes using her. Because even though it hurts atleast you're
                touching me. Like i think its such a destructive way of thinking, like i used to think like its okay if
                you yell at me because atleast hes talking to me. Never settle for less or you'll become like this LMAO.
                okay i dont really like this song but this song is just about how logan uses ethel, and how he would rob
                stores and get into gun fights, while ethel risks her life for his love. Ends up with him getting shot.

                <h2>Family Tree</h2>
                This song exudes a slow-burning intensity. Ethel is forced to run from the police after Logan was killed
                in a gun fight during a bank heist. Honestly i dont even know what this song means so... all i know is
                that it shows how traumatized ethel is especially from all the pressure of having to be a woman in a
                small converative town.

                <h2>Hard Times</h2>
                In this song it talks about how her father sexually assualted her when she was a child. And the trauma,
                confusion she has trying to get through these emotions. To make things worse, her father passes away
                when she was 10, so this abuse was going on when she was a very young child. Joe was preying on Ethel as
                a child. Watching her lustfully instead of lovingly. Usually, birthday parties are supposed to be
                amazing memories for children where they get praise from their parents and friends but for Ethel, her
                birthdays where when her father would prey upon her, watching her. Ethel was too young to notice that
                this type love wasnt right, she thought this type of love as wholesome. Especially when your abuser is
                your father or somebody important, you try to justify their actions. Gaslighting yourself to cope with
                what happened, and pushing it away.

                <h2>Thoroughfare</h2>
                This is where Ethel meets Isaiah, she ran away from home, meets them, and they drive from Texas to
                california. She wanted him to be the man she needed, a man that could protect her and wasn't angry at
                her all the time. And obviously on this long trip they fuck. theres not much to say, this songs like a
                bridge from ethels past, to her death. I think this is the only time that Ethel is somewhat happy (short
                lived) . They fall inlove on the way to cali!!!

                This song is inspired by The Gibson Girl, a feminine character created by Charles Dana Gibson in the
                late 19th and early 20th century United States as a personification of the ‘ideal feminine body’. After
                Ethel and Isaiah arrive in California, he pimps her out in the back of strip clubs and feed her drugs on
                the regular. Ethel loses herself. Isaiah gaslights her, telling her that she should like it, and that
                because she wanted to leave her family so bad that this is what comes out of that. Also shes high like
                24/7 so whatever isaiah says she kinda just does, since its not like she has control over what she's
                doing

                She knows its her end, she tries to run away but can as this is fate. Ethel is screaming but going

                hide, because death is inevitable. He tosses her body into a freezer, eating her.

                This track is an instrumental so no lyrics to look at. Ethel wastes away in the attic of an abandoned
                shack in the woods of northern California. This song represents the decaying of her physical body, it
                sorta happening at the same time as the next song, Televangelism

                children are being exposed to toxic behaviors described as poisonous paint. At the end of the day, Ethel
                is always tied to god and that small towns church.

                Especially when you're in her position, as much as you try to run away and hide from God. He's always
                there, and whenever something bad happens hes always what you run towards. Because thats the only thing
                you were taught to do as a kid. This song to me is like Ethel letting go of everything, since everything
                is done. To me its like after everything, you're still the person you were in the past. Especially when
                religon is forced into you, its kinda all you know. When i was a kid i used to pray to god, quickly, 7
                times (holy number), to calm my father down as he came up the stairs to beat me. I still remember, id
                lock my door to give myself some time to pray to god that maybe I wouldnt go numb this time. Choking on
                my words i kept praying, but I knew nothing would change, that it would happen anyways.

                This song to me is Ethel pleading to Isaiah, asking him, if she was good? That she only wanted him.
                theres nothing to say just enjoy the song. Am i making you feel sick refers to if he felt sick after
                eating a chunck out of her.

                Now i can be annoying and talk about why i like the songs i like LMAO; Also i kinda cant explain good.
                And I dont wanna write paragraph explaining myself so this section might be the worst out of all of
                them.. i'm gonna assign each song i like with a poorly described perfume i make up<br />
                <h2>Waco, Texas</h2>
                Wet wood but like warm wet wood, it reminds me of a candle i bought in this weird schop i found. I guess
                sandal wood and palo santo too, but like its not a strong perfume, wet wood is stronger than both of the
                last notes, uhm maybe like something warm, but not really warm. Like lukewarm idk. Waco texas is very
                like the closer you get to your lover the more it hurts. Thats how it feels like to me. <br />

                    I hope I die today<br />
                    Save me from another late night of red eyes<br />
                    But then the morning comes<br />
                    You were there looking for me but I<br />
                    I was gone, turned my back for a moment and<br />
                    You had fallen apart<br />
                    They've been promising the lights as we beg for our lives<br />
                    Selling pages of the times we've been waiting on<br />
                    Now the weight's too much and I can't hold you anymore<br />
                    How much of a cruel year can you call my fault?<br />
                    Not even the memories are immortal<br />
                    Terrified on this side of a conversation<br />
                    A conversation we'll never come back from<br />
                    I'll never live it down if I never get around it<br />
                    'Cause goddammit, I did it to myself in hindsight<br />
                    I liked him 'cause his rule was, "Do whatever you like, " and I tried, alright<br />
                    Now I'll wear these scars for life<br />
                    I loved you when it hurt inside to<br />

                    Held in my arms, I swore I'd be good to you, be good to you<br />
                    Then sat and watched as you walked away from me (ah, me, me)<br />
                    Yeah, you've changed<br />
                    But did I ever know you?<br />
                    Or did I hold you<br />
                    Facing away from me<br />
                    The air in your room never moves<br />
                    Live and die by TV no one's watching<br />

                    I never meant to hurt you<br />
                    But somehow, I knew I would<br />
                    Will it be like this forever?<br />
                    I'd reach into your body<br />
                    And fix you if I could<br />
                    Will I feel like this forever? (Forever, forever, forever?)<br />
                    Are you angry?<br />
                    Do you hate me?<br />
                    And darling, time may forgive me<br />
                    But I won't<br />
                    You know I'd do anything for you<br />
                    You know it's true, 'cause I've said it to you<br />
                    Held in my arms, I swore I'd be good to you<br />
                    Then sat and watched<br />
                    As you walked away from me (from me)<br />
                    So I bled 'til I cried, 'til I felt I might die<br />
                    To be known the way you should<br />
                    Is to put yourself through hell<br />
                    Still I waited and tried, 'til it killed me<br />
                    'Cause you're right<br />
                    I can wait if I want<br />
                    But it'll never be good enough like I<br />

                <h2>Dust Bowl</h2>
                This song is not warm to me at all like wet cold wood, like cold wet wood. In that order specifically.
                Like inscense note, barely there and maybe like old people house like a dusty scent. and like bedsheets.
                Idk this song reminds me of like waking up after a breakup. longing, not yearning, longing. a very fall
                scent, like wet leaves or something of that sort....patchouli? yeah something like that? oh and like
                grass but not like green grass like a muddy grass. Dirt too, i guess like cold frozen soil too. This
                isnt a warm song to me this is a very like a scent for somebody thats been in a depressive episode in
                the deep south. OH church scent too idk anyways <br />

                I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH!! when i went to the mountains in china i listened to this on repeat for hours.
                Amazing.. anyways this is like so so soosososoosos a floral perfume. Obviously gardenias (ethel cains
                moms favourite flowers are gardenias so), a very warm scent, waking up with your partner underneath the
                sun. warm sheets, white florals, apple, but not a strong apple, pear? sandalwood maybe, no i think this
                would just be a clean floral scent. But not clean, clean in the way that this is when i finally reach
                happiness typa clean. Because like this song is ethel basically imagining her wedding and hoping that
                all the pain her and willoughby go through will be worth it at the end, end as in when they get married.
                So i guess a church scent too but not old, relatively new church scent. And like if cream white had a
                scent it would be in it too. grass, rain, and like patchouli too. I need something in here to represent
                the sadness in this song. I guess bible pages, or like a new book scent. No, new bible scent. Leather?
                idk its been a long time since I've smelt leather. <br />

                    Made a fool of myself down on Tennessee Street<br />
                    It wasn't pretty like the movies<br />
                    It was ugly, like what they all did to me<br />
                    And they did to me what I wouldn't do to anyone<br />
                    You know that's for sure<br />
                    Tell me all the time not to worry (worry)<br />

                    Lay me down where the trees bend low<br />

                    I can hear them singin' (singin')<br />
                    "To love me is to suffer me, " and I believe that<br />

                <h2>Fuck Me Eyes</h2>
                fuck me eyes littearlly is the song that got me through the summer like omg i wouldve died without it.
                Like light vanilla, lipstick, track field smell. Idk how to explain the last part and like everything
                showers i cant put it into scent notes. This song is like preparing yourself for your first date, and
                like american coming of age romcoms. Maybe like a cheap gin note too. And like the scent of cheap bath
                and body works. New leather boots that need to be broken into, and like going to the thrift to find cool
                shoes.

                    When the aching sound of silence used to be our favorite song<br />
                    You and me against the world, you were my man and I your girl<br />
                    We had nothing except each other, you were my whole world<br />
                    Then the day came and you were up and gone<br />

                    Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor<br />
                    Where the world was empty, save you and I<br />
                    Where you came and I laughed, and you left and I cried<br />

                    These dirt roads are empty, the ones we paved ourselves<br />
                    Your mama calls me sometimes to see if I'm doing well<br />
                    And I'd lie to her and say that I'm doing fine<br />
                    When, really, I'd kill myself to hold you one more time<br />
                    And it hurts to miss you, but it's worse to know<br />
                    That I'm the reason you won't come home<br />
                    But I still call home that house in Nebraska<br />

                    Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours<br />
                    (So I died there under you every night, all night)<br />
                    You know, I still wait at the edge of town<br />
                    Praying straight to God that maybe you'll come back around<br />
                    I cry every day and the bottles make it worse<br />
                    'Cause you were the only one I was never scared to tell I hurt<br />
                    And I found photographs of our school, on the day we met<br />
                    I thought that you were so beautiful, it was love, I guess<br />
                    And you might never come back home, and I may never sleep at night<br />
                    But God, I just hope you're doing fine out there, I just pray that you're alright<br />
                    And I feel so alone, and I feel so alone out here<br />
                    I feel so alone, I feel so alone out here<br />
                    And I feel so alone without you, I'm so alone out here<br />
                    I feel so alone, I feel so alone<br />
                    I'm so alone out here without you, baby<br />
