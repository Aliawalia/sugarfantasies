                    <p>Project Name : 4 Figures ; <br /></p>
                    <p>
                        Project Description : This was the first project I did in Adobe illustrator, it's insipired by
                        fruits. All the way to the left is inspired by a pear, the next is an apple, then a peach, and
                        lastly a plum. ; <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Skills used : <br />
                        Creativity - These are my original designs, the theme wasn't developed till midway finished.<br />
                        Proficiency in Adobe illustrator - This was my first project in AI, so there was a bit of a
                        learning curve. I had a bit of a hard time managing my layers and making the pleats, but I'm
                        satisfied with the result. ; <br />

                    <p>Project Name : Pattern Figure Designs ; <br /></p>
                    <p>
                        Project Description : 8 patterns using the pattern tool were used, I had fun layering patterns
                        ontop of solid colors to get a sheer look. Most of these were inspired by outfits I've worn
                        before. Not one of these designs are symmetrical, I'm a big fan of asymmetry, so even if it's
                        just a small detail that throws it off I'll put it in. ; <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Skills used : Adobe - At this point I'm pretty comfortable with Adobe, it was just learning how
                        to make patterns look good repeating. Also using the pathfinder was a bit annoying for me to
                        figure out, but I think it looks good. <br />
                        Creativity - I was actually pretty stumped when figuring out how to incorporate multiple
                        patterns without making it look like an eyesore. I chose to use patterns on smaller parts and
                        solid colors to balance it out.

                    <p>Project Name : Wedding Design ; <br /></p>
                    <p>
                        Project Description : These dresses were inspired by the Edwardian Era and Art Deco wedding
                        dresses. The one in the middle is my favourite and I had the most fun layering the ruffles ontop
                        of eachother. In this project I incorporated shadows underneath clothing pieces that are layered
                        ontop of another. The one on the right is inspired by a dress by Jason Wu that I own. ; <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Skills used : This was my last project in Adobe Illustrator, the blend tool was a bit confusing,
                        and I had trouble trying to make it look good. It's pretty fun to play around with the settings
                        though. The most confusing overall was trying ot figure out how to layer each pleat ontop of
                        eachother. My favourite hair design is the one on the far right, it was inspired by Daisy
                        Buchanan. <br />
                        Creativity - The Edwardian and Art Deco eras are my favourite fashion eras, so obviously I was
                        inspired by it.

                    <p>Project Name : Wedding Design Sketches ; <br /></p>
                    <p>
                        Project Description : These were my initial sketches for my wedding design, I used alcohol
                        markers which were really fun to blend together. I think the most difficult thing was using the
                        right colors, and trying to stop the alcohol markers from bleeding everywhere. Even though I
                        enjoyed blending each color, it was kinda annoying to do so. ; <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Skills used : I haven't used alcohol markers in a while, and I usually paint so learning how to
                        use these well was a bit tricky. I draw alot outside of school so my art skills were really
                        helpful for all my sketches. <br />
                        Creativity - Most of these were made from my imagination, or mixes of Art Deco/Edwardian Era
                        dresses.
